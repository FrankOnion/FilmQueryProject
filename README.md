# Film Query Application

## Project Description

The Film Query Application is a command-line program that interacts with a film database to provide users with information about films. Users can look up films by ID or search for films based on keywords. The application displays details such as title, year, rating, description, language, and cast information for the selected films.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. You will be presented with a menu where you can choose from the following options:
   - Look up a film by its ID.
   - Look up a film by a search keyword.
   - Exit the application.
3. If you choose to look up a film by its ID:
   - Enter the film ID when prompted.
   - The program will display the film's details, including title, year, rating, description, language, and cast.
4. If you choose to look up a film by a search keyword:
   - Enter the keyword you want to search for.
   - The program will display a list of films that match the keyword in their title or description, along with their details.
5. You can continue using the application or exit by selecting the appropriate option.

## Technologies Used

- Java programming language
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) for database access
- Command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction

## Lessons Learned

The development of this project provided valuable learning experiences, including:

- Creating classes and methods in an Object-Oriented manner.
- Implementing JDBC to connect to a relational database.
- Designing and structuring database access methods to retrieve film data.
- Handling user input and menu-driven interactions through the console.
- Displaying information in a user-friendly format.

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation meets the basic requirements, there are opportunities for future enhancements:

- Adding advanced film details such as categories and inventory information.
- Implementing input validation to handle user input errors gracefully.
- Extending the application to support multiple rounds of searching and viewing films.
- Refactoring code for better organization and maintainability.
- Incorporating additional features like user authentication or film recommendations based on user preferences.
